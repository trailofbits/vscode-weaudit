# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/trailofbits/vscode-weaudit/security/) tab.

After the initial reply to your report, we will keep you informed of the progress toward a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.
